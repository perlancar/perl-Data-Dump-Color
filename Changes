0.244   2021-06-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Enable warnings, since vars.pm requires warnings.pm anyway, so no
	  startup-time saving was accomplished.

	- Avoid warning caused by duplicate declaration (GH#10).


0.243   2021-02-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Make Scalar::Util::LooksLikeNumber an optional prereq, to make
	  Data::Dump::Color fatpackable (GH#8).


0.242   2021-02-06  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [ux] Make dd() return the original arguments, like in Data::Dmp
	  and XXX.

          %COLORS.

	- Add color theme: Light.

        - Add demo script.


0.241   2018-12-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR

          Baker).

	  printing string length hints.

         - No functional changes.

         - Workaround for Scalar::Util 1.39 change to looks_like_number()
           (booleanize the result). Use (temporary?) replacement
           Scalar::Util::LooksLikeNumber.


0.20     2013-11-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Remove debug statement (steven--).


0.19     2013-11-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Last fix broke other alignment, second try (reported by Scott Baker).


0.18     2013-11-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Fix another index comment alignment bug: multiline vs singleline
           (spotted by Scott Baker).


0.17     2013-10-31  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Add color theme support (currently undocumented) and 256-color theme
           from Scott Baker.


0.16     2013-10-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Colorize float differently, quote stringy numbers (suggested by Scott
           Baker).

         - Add example script (reworked from Scott Baker's version).

         - Add some FAQ items.


0.15     2013-09-20  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - A couple of fixes and tweaks for index comment.


0.14     2013-09-14  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Sigh, another fix in alignment of index comment for hash.


0.13     2013-09-14  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - A couple more tweaks/fixes for index comment.


0.12     2013-09-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Remove debugging statement (me--).


0.11     2013-09-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - A couple of fixes for index comment alignment.


0.10     2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - A couple of fixes for index comment.


0.09     2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Remove original Data::Dump documentation. This module's docs now only
           explains what's different from Data::Dump.

         - Add 'require Win32::Console::ANSI' on Windows (suggested by dhorne,
           RT#88560).

         - Better color support (colors for keywords, symbols, array indices,
           and hash keys) and fixes to make output similar again to Data::Dump.
           Internally, I now produce both colored and uncolored dump because the
           Data::Dump code often checks for string width and the colored output
           messes up the calculation (an alternative would be to calculate
           against color-stripped text, but that is probably slower still).

         - Add option to turn off array/hash index comment ($INDEX=0).


0.08     2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Fix minor color bug.

         - Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of Module::Build because the latter is
           deprecated in Perl 5.19.


0.07     2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add comment to indicate array index or hash pair index (requested by
           Scott Baker).


0.06     2013-09-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix misaligned hash keys because I colored hash keys too early
           (reported by Scott Baker).


0.05     2012-10-23  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Allow turning color output on/off via $COLOR configuration or COLOR
           environment.
