Revision history for Data-Dump-Color

0.10     2013-09-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - A couple of fixes for index comment.


0.09     2013-09-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - Remove original Data::Dump documentation. This module's docs now only
           explains what's different from Data::Dump.

         - Add 'require Win32::Console::ANSI' on Windows [suggested by dhorne,
           RT#88560].

         - Better color support (colors for keywords, symbols, array indices,
           and hash keys) and fixes to make output similar again to Data::Dump.
           Internally, I now produce both colored and uncolored dump because the
           Data::Dump code often checks for string width and the colored output
           messes up the calculation (an alternative would be to calculate
           against color-stripped text, but that is probably slower still).

         - Add option to turn off array/hash index comment ($INDEX=0).


0.08     2013-09-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - Fix minor color bug.

         - Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of Module::Build because the latter is
           deprecated in Perl 5.19.


0.07     2013-09-10 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add comment to indicate array index or hash pair index (requested by
           Scott Baker).


0.06     2013-09-08 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix misaligned hash keys because I colored hash keys too early
           (reported by Scott Baker).


0.05     2012-10-23 (SHARYANTO)

         - Allow turning color output on/off via $COLOR configuration or COLOR
           environment.


0.04     2012-08-08 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Fix Abstract.


0.03     2012-07-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - Reimplement from using filter to using a modified Data::Dump 1.21.


0.02     2012-07-03 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add missing dep to Exporter-Lite.


0.01     2012-06-27 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release.
